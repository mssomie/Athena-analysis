I need to develop a proper reading scheme to help me utilize the few hours I have to read most days. I have about 3-4 hours I can use to read that course and others. Help me make a reading plan ",
      "zeroShotResponse": "Hi Austen! I'm Athena, your AI study assistant. I'm happy to help you create a reading plan to tackle your structural engineering modules.\n\nTo get started, let's break down your goals and constraints:\n\n**Goals:**\n\n1. Improve understanding of structural engineering modules\n2. Utilize 3-4 hours of daily reading time effectively\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n1. Limited time (3-4 hours per day)\n2. Multiple courses to cover (not just structural engineering)\n\nHere's a suggested reading plan for you:\n\n**Step 1: Prioritize Your Modules**\n\n* Identify the most challenging or critical topics in your structural engineering course.\n* Rank them in order of importance or urgency (e.g., upcoming assignments, exams, or project deadlines).\n\n**Step 2: Allocate Time**\n\n* Divide your 3-4 hours of daily reading time into manageable chunks:\n\t+ 1.5 hours for structural engineering (primary focus)\n\t+ 1-1.5 hours for other courses (secondary focus)\n\t+ 30 minutes for review and note-taking\n\n**Step 3: Create a Daily Reading Schedule**\n\nHere's a sample schedule:\n\n| Time | Course | Activity |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9:00-10:30 AM | Structural Engineering | Read and take notes on priority topics (1.5 hours) |\n| 10:30-11:00 AM | Break | Take a short break to refresh your mind |\n| 11:00-12:00 PM | Other Courses | Read and review materials for other courses (1 hour) |\n| 12:00-12:30 PM | Review and Note-taking | Review notes, summarize key points, and ask yourself questions (30 minutes) |\n\n**Step 4: Customize Your Reading Approach**\n\n* For structural engineering:\n\t+ Start with the most challenging topics or those with upcoming deadlines.\n\t+ Use active reading techniques: read headings, subheadings, and summaries; identify key terms and concepts; and take notes on important points.\n\t+ Use visual aids like diagrams, flowcharts, or mind maps to help you understand complex concepts.\n* For other courses:\n\t+ Focus on understanding key concepts and relationships between topics.\n\t+ Use a similar active reading approach, but with less intensity than structural engineering.\n\n**Step 5: Review and Adjust**\n\n* Regularly review your progress, goals, and schedule.\n* Adjust your reading plan as needed to stay on track or accommodate changes in your course workload.\n\nBy following this plan, you'll be able to make the most of your limited reading time, prioritize your structural engineering modules, and still have time for other courses. Remember to stay flexible and adjust the plan as needed to fit your unique learning style and needs.\n\nHow does this plan sound, Austen? Do you have any questions or would you like to modify it to better suit your needs?",

This plan incorporates the effective study strategies I've researched to ensure you make the most of your time.\n\n**Daily Reading Plan:**\n\n**Hour 1: Review and Retrieval (30 minutes) + Lecture Slides Review (30 minutes)**\n\n1. Begin by reviewing notes from the previous day's lectures or previous weeks' material (30 minutes). Try to recall key concepts and formulas without looking at your notes or textbook. This is your **retrieval practice**.\n2. Next, review the lecture slides for the current topic, taking notes on any important points or questions you have (30 minutes). This will help you **reinforce your understanding** and identify areas where you need more practice.\n\n**Hour 2: Focused Reading (45 minutes) + Break (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Choose a specific topic or chapter from your structural engineering textbook or notes (45 minutes). **Focus on understanding the concepts** rather than just reading through the material. Take notes, ask yourself questions, and try to relate the concepts to real-world scenarios or previous topics.\n2. Take a 15-minute break to stretch, grab a snack, or refresh your mind.\n\n**Hour 3: Practice Problems and Peer Teaching (45 minutes) + Review Previous Exams (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Practice problems**: Attempt to solve exercises or problems related to the topic you're currently studying (45 minutes). This will help you **apply your knowledge** and identify areas where you need more practice.\n2. Review previous exam questions or practice quizzes (15 minutes) to **reinforce your understanding** and get a sense of the types of questions you may be asked.\n\n**Hour 4: Varied Resources and Reflection (45 minutes) + Goal Setting (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explore varied resources**: Watch video lectures, online tutorials, or podcasts related to the topic (45 minutes). This will help you **gain different perspectives** and deepen your understanding.\n2. Reflect on what you've learned during the day (15 minutes). **Set specific goals** for the next day or week, and make a plan to achieve them.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Minimize distractions**: Try to study in a quiet, comfortable space with minimal interruptions.\n* **Use active learning techniques**: Engage with the material by asking yourself questions, creating concept maps, or summarizing key points in your own words.\n* **Review regularly**: Set aside time each week to review material from previous weeks or months to reinforce your long-term retention.\n* **Teach someone else**: Find a study buddy or teach a concept to someone else to **reinforce your own understanding**.\n\nBy following this plan, you'll be able to make the most of your 3-4 hour daily reading window, incorporating effective study strategies to improve your understanding of structural engineering concepts. Remember to stay flexible and adjust the plan as needed to fit your learning style and schedule. Good luck, Austen!",
